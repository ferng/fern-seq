### amidiminder Rules file

# amidiminder watches ALSA MIDI system. When a port is added, the rules in this
# file are scanned to automatically connect it up if possible.

# amidiminder also watches for connections made by other tools like aconnect
# or aconnectgui.  If those ports are disconnected (accidentially unplug a
# USB MIDI device, say) then amidiminder will remember that it had been
# manually connected before. When the port returns (plug it back in), then
# the previously made connection will be restored.

### Standard Rules
###
#.hw <---> .app
  # Interconnect all hardware and application ports.
  # For simple set ups, this is often all you need.
  # Comment this out if you need to be more explicit about what is connected
  # to what.

RtMidiIn Client <-x- *
RtMidiOut Client -x-> *
  # Don't auto connect anything to these ports. They are generic client
  # names used by various applications, and could mean anything.
